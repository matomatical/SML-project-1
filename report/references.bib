% Initially we split up the reading of our first three identified papers:
% Alice read this paper:
@inproceedings{layton2010authorship,
  title={Authorship attribution for twitter in 140 characters or less},
  author={Layton, Robert and Watters, Paul and Dazeley, Richard},
  booktitle={2010 Second Cybercrime and Trustworthy Computing Workshop},
%   pages={1--8},
  year={2010},
%   organization={IEEE}
}

% Matt read this one about stylometric analysis:
@inproceedings{bhargava2013stylometric,
  title={Stylometric analysis for authorship attribution on twitter},
  author={Bhargava, Mudit and Mehndiratta, Pulkit and Asawa, Krishna},
  booktitle={International Conference on Big Data Analytics},
%   pages={37--47},
  year={2013},
%   organization={Springer}
}

% And Marvin read this one:
@article{rocha2016authorship,
  title={Authorship attribution for social media forensics},
  author={Rocha, Anderson and Scheirer, Walter J and Forstall, Christopher W and Cavalcante, Thiago and Theophilo, Antonio and Shen, Bingyu and Carvalho, Ariadne RB and Stamatatos, Efstathios},
  journal={IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security},
%   volume={12},
%   number={1},
%   pages={5--33},
  year={2016},
%   publisher={IEEE}
}

% We decided to expand and read a few more papers:

% Alice and Matt both read this one:
@inproceedings{schwartz2013authorship,
  title={Authorship attribution of micro-messages},
  author={Schwartz, Roy and Tsur, Oren and Rappoport, Ari and Koppel, Moshe},
  booktitle={Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing},
%   pages={1880--1891},
  year={2013}
}
% Which introduced k-signatures and flexible patterns

% Matt also read this one:
@inproceedings{sari2017continuous,
  title={Continuous n-gram representations for authorship attribution},
  author={Sari, Yunita and Vlachos, Andreas and Stevenson, Mark},
  booktitle={Proceedings of the 15th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Volume 2, Short Papers},
%   pages={267--273},
  year={2017}
}
% might be useful to cite in a hypothetical future works/related works section
% but it's otherwise pretty tangential

% Alice also found this one,
% with a nice summary of SCAP, CNG, and RLP in the introduction,
% and it's otherwise about applying clustering algorithms:
@article{layton2013automated,
  title={Automated unsupervised authorship analysis using evidence accumulation clustering},
  author={Layton, Robert and Watters, Paul and Dazeley, Richard},
  journal={Natural Language Engineering},
%   volume={19},
%   number={1},
%   pages={95--120},
  year={2013},
%   publisher={Cambridge University Press}
}

% This is the one that introduced RLP
@article{layton2012recentred,
  title={Recentred local profiles for authorship attribution},
  author={Layton, Robert and Watters, Paul and Dazeley, Richard},
  journal={Natural Language Engineering},
%   volume={18},
%   number={3},
%   pages={293--312},
  year={2012},
%   publisher={Cambridge University Press}
}

% And CNG (have we actually gone and read this one?)
@inproceedings{kevselj2003n,
  title={N-gram-based author profiles for authorship attribution},
  author={Ke{\v{s}}elj, Vlado and Peng, Fuchun and Cercone, Nick and Thomas, Calvin},
  booktitle={Proceedings of the conference pacific association for computational linguistics, PACLING},
%   volume={3},
%   pages={255--264},
  year={2003},
%   organization={sn}
}

% This one introduced SCAP and SPI ("simplified profile intersection"):
@inproceedings{frantzeskou2006effective,
  title={Effective identification of source code authors using byte-level information},
  author={Frantzeskou, Georgia and Stamatatos, Efstathios and Gritzalis, Stefanos and Katsikas, Sokratis},
  booktitle={Proceedings of the 28th international conference on Software engineering},
%   pages={893--896},
  year={2006},
%   organization={ACM}
}

% This tutorial helped clarify the definition of RLP, which was possibly incorrect in the paper
@online{layton2014tutorial,
  author = {Layton, Robert},
  title = {A tutorial on Local n-grams for Authorship Attribution},
  year = 2014,
  url = {https://github.com/robertlayton/authorship_tutorials/blob/master/LNGTutorial.ipynb},
  urldate = {2019-09-09}
}

% This one says that char n-grams of 4 were best for twitter 
% Can be replaced with the forensic one if references are too long
@inproceedings{layton2010authorship,
  title={Authorship Attribution for Twitter in 140 Characters or Less},
  author={Layton, Robert and Watters, Paul and Dazeley, Richard},
  booktitle={2010 Second Cybercrime and Trustworthy Computing Workshop},
  pages={1--8},
  year={2010},
  organization={IEEE}
