% Initially we split up the reading of our first three identified papers:
% Alice read this paper:
@inproceedings{layton2010authorship,
  title={Authorship attribution for twitter in 140 characters or less},
  author={Layton, Robert and Watters, Paul and Dazeley, Richard},
  booktitle={2010 Second Cybercrime and Trustworthy Computing Workshop},
  pages={1--8},
  year={2010},
  organization={IEEE}
}

% Matt read this one about stylometric analysis:
@inproceedings{bhargava2013stylometric,
  title={Stylometric analysis for authorship attribution on twitter},
  author={Bhargava, Mudit and Mehndiratta, Pulkit and Asawa, Krishna},
  booktitle={International Conference on Big Data Analytics},
  pages={37--47},
  year={2013},
  organization={Springer}
}

% And Marvin read this one:
@article{rocha2016authorship,
  title={Authorship attribution for social media forensics},
  author={Rocha, Anderson and Scheirer, Walter J and Forstall, Christopher W and Cavalcante, Thiago and Theophilo, Antonio and Shen, Bingyu and Carvalho, Ariadne RB and Stamatatos, Efstathios},
  journal={IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security},
  volume={12},
  number={1},
  pages={5--33},
  year={2016},
  publisher={IEEE}
}

% We decided to expand and read a few more papers:

% Alice and Matt both read this one:
@inproceedings{schwartz2013authorship,
  title={Authorship attribution of micro-messages},
  author={Schwartz, Roy and Tsur, Oren and Rappoport, Ari and Koppel, Moshe},
  booktitle={Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing},
  pages={1880--1891},
  year={2013}
}
% Which introduced k-signatures and flexible patterns

% Matt also read this one:
@inproceedings{sari2017continuous,
  title={Continuous n-gram representations for authorship attribution},
  author={Sari, Yunita and Vlachos, Andreas and Stevenson, Mark},
  booktitle={Proceedings of the 15th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Volume 2, Short Papers},https://www.overleaf.com/project/5d6395b28ac752377a5e08b2
  pages={267--273},
  year={2017}
}
% might be useful to cite in a hypothetical future works/related works section
% but it's otherwise pretty tangential

% Alice also found this one,
% with a nice summary of SCAP, CNG, and RLP in the introduction,
% and it's otherwise about applying clustering algorithms:
@article{layton2013automated,
  title={Automated unsupervised authorship analysis using evidence accumulation clustering},
  author={Layton, Robert and Watters, Paul and Dazeley, Richard},
  journal={Natural Language Engineering},
  volume={19},
  number={1},
  pages={95--120},
  year={2013},
  publisher={Cambridge University Press}
}

% This is the one that introduced RLP
@article{layton2012recentred,
  title={Recentred local profiles for authorship attribution},
  author={Layton, Robert and Watters, Paul and Dazeley, Richard},
  journal={Natural Language Engineering},
  volume={18},
  number={3},
  pages={293--312},
  year={2012},
  publisher={Cambridge University Press}
}

% And CNG (have we actually gone and read this one?)
@inproceedings{kevselj2003n,
  title={N-gram-based author profiles for authorship attribution},
  author={Ke{\v{s}}elj, Vlado and Peng, Fuchun and Cercone, Nick and Thomas, Calvin},
  booktitle={Proceedings of the conference pacific association for computational linguistics, PACLING},
  volume={3},
  pages={255--264},
  year={2003},
  organization={sn}
}
